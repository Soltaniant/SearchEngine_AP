## Inverted Index!
üé• [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf6HbY2PQDw) for more details!
### üìÑ Documents
```dtd
Document 1: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Document 2: The lazy dog slept in the sun.
```

### Tokenize
```dtd
Document 1: [The, quick, brown, fox, jumped, over, the lazy, dog]
Document 2: [The, lazy, dog, slept, in, the, sun]
```

### Index
```dtd
The    -> Document 1, Document 2
Quick  -> Document 1
Brown  -> Document 1
Fox    -> Document 1
Jumped -> Document 1
Over   -> Document 1
Lazy   -> Document 1, Document 2
Dog    -> Document 1, Document 2
Slept  -> Document 2
In     -> Document 2
Sun    -> Document 2
```

**Q:** what if we search for `brown`?

### Normalize before indexing
```dtd
THE    -> Document 1, Document 2
QUICK  -> Document 1
BROWN  -> Document 1
FOX    -> Document 1
JUMPED -> Document 1
OVER   -> Document 1
LAZY   -> Document 1, Document 2
DOG    -> Document 1, Document 2
SLEPT  -> Document 2
IN     -> Document 2
SUN    -> Document 2
```
